# Sorting-array-elements-without-using-sort-methods
 In this assignment, you will perform various operations with the elements in an array. Before performing these operations, you need to follow these steps: 1 - You will get one positive integer on the screen, let's denote this number by 𝒏. 2 - You will define one integer array of length 𝒏 and fill this array by selecting random integers from the range [−𝟐𝟓, 𝟐𝟓] (including -25 and 25). 3 - After assigning numbers to the array, you will press the array elements side by side, leaving a space between the numbers. After doing these operations, you will print the largest negative number of the series on the screen. If there is no negative number in the array, then you will accept the selected number as 0. It will be done without using the sorting functions.
